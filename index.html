    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>This site shares views from LGBTQ young adults about how they are shown in media. They talk about what helps them feel seen and what makes things harder. The goal is to help people understand what good and fair media looks like.</p>
    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>Movies and shows shape how people think. If LGBTQ people are only shown in certain ways, that can make others see them that way too. This site gives LGBTQ voices a space to explain what works and what doesn’t.</p>
